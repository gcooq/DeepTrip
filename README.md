# DeepTrip <br>
source code for DeepTrip
This is the implementation of the deep learning based DeepTrip model.

# Environment
* python >= 2.7
* Tensorflow 1.8 or ++

# Dataset
We use four different cities extrated from real-world Location-based Social Network data as follows. 
* Flickr: <https://bitbucket.org/d-chen/tour-cikm16>
* Foursquare(Tokyo): <https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset>
* (remark) Please do not use these datasets for commercial purpose. For academic uses, please cite the paper. For Foursquare dataset, we use the same method as in [35] to construct the social networks. Thanks for their help.(see the reference [2,35] in the paper).
# Usage
*  python gae_context.py 

# Reference
Hope such an implementation could help you on your projects. Any comments and feedback are appreciated.
